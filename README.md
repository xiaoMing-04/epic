Lazy afternoon,<br>
The cat is yawning<br>
I think of you, suddenly and unpreparedly<br>
You and I like, a fairy tale, at that time, did you know that thing<br>
But with the different ending<br>
I told myself, million of times<br>
That if I got another chance<br>
I told myself, million of times<br>
Will definitely<br>
But today I understand one thing<br>
Even if there is another chance<br>
Reality wonâ€™t be better.
